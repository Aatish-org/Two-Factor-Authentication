### **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) Implementation Using Python**

This project demonstrates a simple yet secure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system using Python, Flask, Flask-Mail, `pyotp`, and `qrcode`. The application allows users to enable 2FA for their accounts, enhancing security by requiring a one-time password (OTP) generated by an authenticator app such as Google Authenticator or Authy.

#### **Features:**
- **OTP Generation**: Generates a unique secret key for each user using `pyotp`.
- **QR Code Generation**: Displays a QR code that can be scanned by 2FA apps, simplifying the setup process.
- **Email Integration**: Sends email notifications to users upon successful authentication using Flask-Mail.
- **User Input**: Allows users to input their email and verify the OTP generated by the authenticator app.
- **Security**: Adds an additional layer of security to protect user accounts.

#### **Technologies Used:**
- Python, Flask, Flask-Mail
- `pyotp` for OTP generation
- `qrcode` for generating QR codes
- HTML/CSS for the web interface

This project serves as a practical example of integrating 2FA into a web application, ensuring secure authentication for users.
