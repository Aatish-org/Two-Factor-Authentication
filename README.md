# Two-Factor-Authentication
A simple 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) system using Python, Flask, `pyotp`, `qrcode`, and Flask-Mail. This project generates OTPs for users, displays a QR code for easy setup with 2FA apps, and sends email notifications upon successful verification, adding an extra layer of security to user authentication.
